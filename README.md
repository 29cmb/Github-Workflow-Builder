![Overflow](client/public/assets/FullLogo.png)


A drag-and-drop system for creating github workflows! Definitely my biggest project yet!

---

I made this because making workflows was always a tedious task for me to do efficiently and accurately, but with Overflow, the task of making github workflows is easier than ever with our visual-based system.

This was made for [hackclub arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) and is hosted through their free vps!

> [!WARNING]\
> Overflow is a work in progress and is made by a singular person (me), don't expect extremely frequent updates, and a todo list can be found [here](./development/TODO.md)

# Guides and Documentation
All documentation can be found in the [docs directory](./docs/), and they explain many things, like usage, self-hosting, and more!
