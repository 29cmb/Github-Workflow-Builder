A drag-and-drop system for creating github workflows! Definitely my biggest project yet!

---
Workflows are weird, you make them to do very specific tasks, and they're not always well documented. To fix this, I made the overflow project, a visual-based editing system for creating github workflows efficiently. Written in NodeJS for the backend and React for the frontend!

This was made for [hackclub arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) and is hosted through their free vps!

> [!WARNING]\
> Overflow is a work in progress and is made by a singular person (me), don't expect extremely frequent updates, and a todo list can be found [here](https://github.com/29cmb/Github-Workflow-Builder/blob/main/development/TODO.md)
